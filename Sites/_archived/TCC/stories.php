						<h2>From star quarterback to cancer survivor.</h2>
						<p>During his football days, Kyle Williams spent years living with a dull pain in his testicle. Thinking it couldn&rsquo;t possibly be anything serious, he always ignored it. Until the day he discovered a small lump.</p>
						<p>After having surgery two weeks later to remove the testicle, Kyle was diagnosed with a rare, reoccurring, aggressive form of cancer. At the time, he was just 23 years old.</p>
						<p>More tests were scheduled, and lumps were discovered in front of his heart and in his lymphatic system. Major surgery was required to remove all of the lymph nodes, and Kyle was scheduled for six weeks of six-hour chemo sessions.</p>					
						<p>The surgery and chemo were successful, and after a year-long battle, Kyle was told he had beaten testicular cancer. He&rsquo;s now on a remission plan that requires him to go in for tests twice a year. Kyle is now an advocate for early detection, because he believes the spread of his cancer could have been avoided if he&rsquo;d spoken up earlier about the pain he was experiencing.</p>
						<p>Kyle and his wife live in Burlington, Ontario. He coaches high school football and runs a health and wellness company educating kids about the importance of good health. And about speaking up when you think something could be wrong.</p>

						<h2>He saves lives. And someone saved his.</h2>
						<p>Sean Sparling has dedicated his life to saving other people&rsquo;s lives. After working for a decade as a paramedic, both on land and in a helicopter, Sean switched careers in 2003 to pursue his dream of being a firefighter.</p>
						<p>It was in February 2011 that Sean began to experience swelling in his right testicle.</p>
						<p>Within just three weeks, he&rsquo;d undergone an ultrasound, been told it was testicular cancer, and had surgery to remove the testicle.</p>
						<p>Two months later, Sean was scheduled for radiation. He was put through 20 grueling radiation treatments over the course of five weeks. Each treatment was only two minutes long, but they took a great physical toll on him, sapping his energy and leading to nausea, diarrhea, and occasional vomiting.</p>
						<p>The effects of the radiation lasted for several weeks after he&rsquo;d completed the treatments, and Sean says there were times he wondered if they&rsquo;d ever go away.</p>
						<p>But slowly and surely, they did. Sean says his battle with testicular cancer inspired him to live a richer, fuller life. He&rsquo;s also resumed active firefighting and paramedic work. He&rsquo;s taken care of himself, and now he&rsquo;s getting back to looking out for others.</p>

						<h2>Cancer was just one chapter in his story.</h2>
						<p>A graduate of Ryersonâ€™s theatre program, Daniel Schneiderman was living in downtown Toronto working as an actor in 2005, when he happened to notice a hard, pea-sized lump on his testicle. At the time, Daniel was a totally healthy 27-year-old, but something told him he should get it checked out right away.</p>
						<p>After an ultrasound, Daniel was told all signs indicated the lump was cancer, and that the testicle would have to be removed. After surgery, Daniel learned that he faced the best possible scenario for those with the disease: the cancer had been caught early, it hadn&rsquo;t spread, and was completely contained to the testicle.</p>
						<p>Following his surgery, he started a surveillance plan whereby he would be monitored regularly over five years. He chose the surveillance plan, and has been living cancer-free ever since.</p>
						<p>Given his passion for the theatre, it wasn&rsquo;t long before Daniel started thinking about bringing his battle with testicular cancer to the stage. He decided to chronicle his experience and raise awareness of the disease by writing a one-man show called &ldquo;My Left Nut.&rdquo;</p>
						<p>An honest, humorous portrayal of what young men go through when battling testicular cancer, Daniel toured the show to high schools across Canada, advocating the importance of early detection and early diagnosis, and eliciting more than a few laughs along the way.</p>
