						<h2>A message from Cheryl Perry,<br />founder of Testicular Cancer Canada</h2>
						<hr>
						<p>On April 22, 2003, my son Adam was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Adam was only 18 years old and looking forward to his future after finishing high school.</p>
						<p>Adam spent the rest of the school year in a chemotherapy centre. In the months that followed, Adam told me a story of when he was in grade 10 and his testicle swelled; at the time, he was too embarrassed to say anything about it. Throughout the long hours of chemotherapy, Adam dreamt of educating other young men about testicular cancer &mdash; going into schools and teaching young men not to be afraid of telling someone if they suspected they had a problem in their testicles.</p>
						<p>On November 9, 2003, just 7 months after his diagnosis, Adam died.</p>						
						<p>After he passed away, I vowed to make my son&rsquo;s dream come true and, with the help of friends and family, I formed Testicular Cancer Canada.</p>					
						<p>We&rsquo;re committed to raising awareness about testicular cancer while supporting those affected by the disease. We equip men with the tools they need to identify testicular cancer early so they can avoid painful, lengthy treatment and life-altering complications like impotence and infertility.</p>
						<p>To contribute to our cause, visit our <a href="donate">Donate</a> section. With your help, we can continue our mission to educate and support. Thanks for reading.</p>						
						<p>Sincerely,</p>
