								<h2>Look</h2>
								<p>Check your testicles just after you've had a bath or shower, when the muscles in the scrotum are relaxed, making it easier for you to feel any lumps, growths or tenderness. Stand in front of the mirror. Look for any swelling on the skin of your scrotum.</p>						
							</div>
	
							<div class="tc-check push-right">
								<img src="img/hold-tc.png" />
								<h2>Hold</h2>
								<p>Hold your scrotum in your hands and feel the size and weight of each testicle. It is common for one testicle to be slightly larger or hang lower than the other.</p>						
							</div>
							
							<div class="tc-check push-right">
								<img src="img/feel-tc.png" />
								<h2>Feel</h2>
								<p>Feel each testicle and roll it between your thumb and finger. It should feel smooth. It's normal to feel a soft, tender tube towards the back of each testicle. You shouldn't feel any pain when checking your testicles.</p>
							</div>						
	
							<div class="tc-check">
								<img src="img/repeat-tc.png" />
								<h2>Repeat</h2>
								<p>Once familiar with how your testicles feel, keep an eye out for any changes. If you detect a change, don&rsquo;t freak out, just see a doctor as soon as possible.</p>

						<h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
						<p>In addition to the four steps, you should also watch out for the following signs and symptoms. Many signs and symptoms of testicular cancer can be caused by other health conditions and are vague and often mild. But it&rsquo;s important to have any unusual symptoms checked by a doctor, especially if they last longer than 2&ndash;4 weeks.</p>

						<p><span>Signs and symptoms of testicular cancer are:</span></p>
						<ul class="signs">
							<li>Painless lump on the testicle &ndash; can vary in size from a few millimetres to several centimetres</li>

							<li>Painful testicle</li>
							<li>Swelling of a testicle</li>
							<li>Enlarged lymph nodes in the abdomen or neck</li>
						</ul>
							
						<p><span>If the cancer grows larger or spreads to other parts of the body, including other organs, additional signs may arise:</span></p>
						<ul class="signs">
							<li>Back pain &ndash; if the cancer spreads to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes</li>
							<li>Buildup of fluid in the abdomen</li>
							<li>Cough with or without blood-stained sputum &ndash; if the cancer spreads to the lungs</li>
							<li>Shortness of breath due to buildup of fluid around the lungs</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p><span>Rarer signs and symptoms include:</span></p>
						<ul class="signs">
							<li>Excessive hair growth</li>
